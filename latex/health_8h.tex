class \mbox{\hyperlink{classHealth}{Health}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The \mbox{\hyperlink{classHealth}{Health}} class is an abstract class that handles health behaviors. This class is abstract to avoid repeating the same things for all the behaviors that extend it. Most objects that have health do not have all the actions. For example, enemies do not heal but they need to get their health decreased through attacks. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item
